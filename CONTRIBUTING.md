## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TurboLFS/TurboLFS
   cd TurboLFS
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Use `yarn` to install all required packages:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. **Start the TurboLFS Server**
   In a **separate terminal window** (PowerShell, Terminal, or Command Prompt), run the following command:

   ```bash
   node src turbo server --port 3000 --objects-repo=TurboLFS/lfs-test --object-repo-token=PUBLIC
   ```

   This will launch a local TurboLFS server acting as a Git LFS proxy.

4. **Clone the LFS Test Repository**
   In your original terminal, run:

   ```bash
   node src clone https://github.com/TurboLFS/lfs-test
   ```

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è If the cloning process fails, try enabling Git trace logging for more detailed error output:

   * **In PowerShell**:

     ```bash
     $env:GIT_TRACE=1
     node src clone https://github.com/TurboLFS/lfs-test
     ```
